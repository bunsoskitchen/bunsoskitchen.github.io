		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			Our client plans to have a business selling homemade fillipino dessert. The project goal is to help our client kick start his business by creating an eCommerce web application for him to provide his customers a more professional and business-like feeling when they order his desserts through the website.
		</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Scope</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			The project scope will include: the owner of the business (our client Carl Perez), friends and family (his customers), the developers of the website (our team), and the project manager (Professor Yang).
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, our client does not have a website for his customers to order his desserts. We would like to solve that problem by creating him a website that his customers can use to order his desserts in an online format.
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of our project is to create him a safe, reliable, and working website so that he is able to kickstart his business and hopefully expand beyond.
		</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			The project goal is to provide our client with a digital platform where he can sell, advertise, and modify desserts seasonally to local customers. Our team will accomplish this by developing an ecommerce web application that includes both essential and unique features such as a user account system, admin account system, product listing, shopping cart, customer review, and Q&A chatbot just to name a few.
		</p>
		<p>
			We plan to utilize several technologies during implementation for the project’s front end, back end, and database. In the front end, we will use: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and React. For the back end and database, we will use: Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
		</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Highlights</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			With our project, we will be providing our client with a professional and more official method of making his dessert products accessible to targeted customers as opposed to more casual approaches such as utilizing social media to conduct sales. Additionally, our project will perform as an efficient and user-friendly ecommerce web application that fulfills the needs of both our client and the customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			By utilizing the MERN stack architecture for our project’s development, our group will be able to accomplish our project’s goal while also giving us all the opportunity to explore a popular industry practice.
